## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of DevFlow seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to jordancoinjackson@gmail.com.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Measures

DevFlow implements several security measures to protect your data and systems:

### Code Security

1. **Secure Logging**: All logs are sanitized to prevent sensitive information leakage, including credentials, tokens, and secrets
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before use
3. **Dependency Security**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities
4. **Static Code Analysis**: Continuous scanning for common security issues with CodeQL
5. **Container Security**: Scanning of container images with Trivy for vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Using the principle of least privilege for all operations
2. **Environment Security**: Secure handling of environment variables
3. **Secure Defaults**: Secure default configurations for all features
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling to prevent information leakage
5. **Secure Communication**: Using secure protocols for all network communications

### CI/CD Security

1. **Dependency Review**: Automated dependency review on pull requests
2. **Secret Scanning**: Preventing secrets from being committed to the repository
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in the codebase
4. **Security Testing**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines
5. **Custom Security Checks**: Additional checks for potential security issues

## Security Update Process

When security vulnerabilities are discovered, we follow these steps:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact of the vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: Develop a fix in a private fork/branch
3. **Security Release**: Release a security update with clear documentation
4. **Disclosure**: Publish a security advisory with details about the vulnerability

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. Keep DevFlow updated to the latest version
2. Use the secure logging feature and regularly check logs for suspicious activity
3. Always run with minimum required permissions
4. Keep your dependencies up to date
5. Enable all security features provided by DevFlow
6. Report any security issues following our disclosure policy
