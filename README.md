npm install -g @jordanjackson/devflow

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
devflow init --type monorepo  # or --type single

# Auto-detect services
devflow detect

# Run a workflow
devflow test test_db --env development --parallel
```

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ Intelligent workflow automation
- üèóÔ∏è Monorepo support with workspace management

## üìñ Project Structure Support

DevFlow now supports various project structures:

```yaml
# devflow.yaml
project:
  type: monorepo  # or 'single'
  packages:
    - name: frontend
      path: ./packages/frontend
      env: [development, test]
    - name: backend
      path: ./packages/backend
      env: [development, test]
  services:
    - type: database
      image: postgres:13
    - type: cache
      image: redis:alpine
```

## Testing Security Features and GitHub Workflows

Before pushing changes to GitHub, you can test the security features and GitHub workflow configurations locally.

### Dependency Confusion Protection

DevFlow implements several measures to protect against dependency confusion attacks:

1. **Scoped Package Name**: Using `@jordanjackson/devflow` as the package name adds a layer of protection.

2. **Registry Configuration**: The `.npmrc` file explicitly configures registry sources:
   ```
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   @jordanjackson:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
   ```
   This ensures that packages with your organization's scope only come from your private registry.

3. **Automated Checks**: GitHub workflows verify proper configuration of dependency protection:
   - Validates `.npmrc` configuration
   - Verifies package name scoping
   - Checks for potential namespace conflicts
   - Tests for dependency confusion vulnerabilities

4. **Security Audit**: Run checks for dependency confusion:
   ```bash
   npm run security:check
   ```

For more information about dependency confusion attacks, see [this explanation](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610).

### Testing Security Features

To test the security features implemented in the codebase, run:

```bash
npm run security:test
```

This will test:
- Secure logging and redaction functionality
- Log level control
- Secure command execution
- Log file rotation and cleanup
- Basic security scans

### Testing GitHub Workflows Locally

To test GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing, we use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), which runs your GitHub Actions locally in Docker containers.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Docker and ensure it's running
2. Install act:
   - macOS: `brew install act`
   - Other platforms: Follow [installation instructions](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation)
3. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and add your secrets

#### Running Workflow Tests

Run the following command to test your GitHub Actions workflows:

```bash
npm run github:test
```

This will:
1. Detect available workflows
2. Allow you to select which workflow or job to test
3. Run the workflow locally using act
4. Report the results

#### Limitations

When testing locally:
- Some GitHub-specific environment variables may not be available
- Some GitHub Actions features may behave differently
- Network-dependent services might need to be mocked

### Pre-Commit Security Checks

Before committing, you can run a quick security check:

```bash
npm run security:check
```

This checks for:
- Typosquatting in dependencies
- Known malicious packages
- Dependency confusion vulnerabilities
- Package integrity issues
